# Objective:
# Boot a virtual Linux system in QEMU with a dummy PCI device that can be
# bound to the uio_pci_generic driver and interacted with from user space.
#
# Find that the simple emulated PCI device 'pci-testdev' does *not* seem to
# correctly bind with the uio_pci_generic driver; so we also emulate another
# PCI device: virtio-serial-pci; this does seem to bind with the
# uio_pci_generic driver.

# Boot into the Qemu VM off it's disk

   echo "The Qemu QCOW disk isn't ready; run the qemu_setup_alpine.sh script,

#--- Reg the -enable-kvm option:
# Keeping the -enable-kvm is (really) good for performance; however,
# it only seems to work if:
# a) your host (which could itslef be a guest!) supports KVM, and
# b) only support one instance of a KVM-enabled guest on a given
# system. Hence, it fails to boot if you have another hypervisor - like Oracle
# VirtualBox that's also using kvm - running simultaneously.
#---
  
#---
# Once in the guest:
#  Login as root (give the password you specified at installation)
#  Only the first time:
#   apk update
#   apk add pciutils bash
#  modprobe uio_pci_generic
